### If you've spotted a spammer that wasn't caught by the filter:
* If you notice a set, or even an entire 'genre' of spammers that are being poorly detected (or not at all), you can submit a [filter suggestion here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=filtering&template=spam_detection.yaml&title=Filtering%3A+%28Write+a+short+title+here%29)

### If you've found false positives:
* If you noticed _any_ false positives in "Auto Smart" mode, or a very large number of false positives in "Sensitive Smart" mode, also feel free to submit a [filter suggestion here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=filtering&template=spam_detection.yaml&title=Filtering%3A+%28Write+a+short+title+here%29) to report it

### _New:_ Contribute to the Spam List Repository:
* I've also created a [separate repository](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Lists) (a GitHub project basically) to create spam lists to catch certain elusive spammers that do not exhibit normal spammer signatures
* The lists contain the following things found in YouTube comments:
   * Spam **Domains**
   * Scam **Instagram / Telegram usernames** (usernames _mentioned_ in the comment, not the username of the commenter themselves)
   * Names / Usernames used in "**Spam Threads**"
* Visit the [main project page](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Lists) to learn about how you can contribute to the YT Spam Lists project, and visit the [project's wiki](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Domains-List/wiki)
* To read the 3 specific categories above and what I mean exactly, visit [this wiki page](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Domains-List/wiki) for examples
