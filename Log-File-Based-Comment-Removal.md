## Delete Comments Later
* You do not have to remove comments immediately after scanning if you save the log file
* The option to delete comments using a list/log file can be found on the main menu

## Partial List Removal
* You do not need to remove all the comments from a log file in one go
* The program will _save your progress_ so you can continue later
   * It will track how many comments you have deleted from that log file, how many remain, and how many failed
   * It also gives you the option to re-try removing failed comments

## Advantages
* If you are dealing with huge numbers of spam comments per scan, it can be easy to go over the [daily API quota limit](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Understanding-YouTube-API-Quota-Limits)
   * You can effectively remove a maximum of 10,000 comments per day, or scan up 1,000,000 comments per day
* With this feature, if you run up against the API quota, you can keep the log and delete the comments in chunks each day
