### Automatic Update Checking
* Upon running, the program will automatically check for program and spam list updates, and will notify you (in the Scanning Mode Menu / Main Menu) if there is a new version
* Automatic update checking can be disabled via the config file setting: `auto_check_update`
* You can also manually check for updates (such as when automatic checking is disabled) by selecting that option in the Main Menu

### Automatic Update Downloading
* You can have the program download the latest .exe version for you
* This option will be presented after you use the 'Check For Updates' option in the Main Menu
   * The program will also verify the downloaded file's hash to verify it was downloaded correctly
