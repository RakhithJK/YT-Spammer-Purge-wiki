## Currently Planned Features
* Colored Text

## Eventual Planned Features
* Allow choosing mode to handle comment: Reject, Hold for Review, or Report as Spam (currently just rejects, aka deletes)
* Auto-Search: Ability to scan for usernames and comments containing certain words, etc

## Whenever I Get Around to It
* Graphic User Interface (v2.0)

## Maybe Some Day
* Self-Hosted web version, wouldn't require downloading or setting up your own Google Cloud project
* Auto Full-Scan Mode: Scans entire channel until more than ~100 comments scanned without spammer found, then stops automatically
* "Undo" function - When the program 'deletes' comments, it actually marks them as rejected. If you still have the comment ID, you can actually use the API to mark it as accepted to undo deleting them. Could allow importing a log file from a previous run to undo deleted comments if desired for some reason.
