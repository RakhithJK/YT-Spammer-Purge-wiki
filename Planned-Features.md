## Currently Planned Features
* Detection of 'spam threads' where multiple bots talk to each other, without relying on a spam list

## Relatively Soonâ„¢
* Option to search also obfuscated versions of entered strings

## Whenever I Get Around to It
* Monitoring Mode: Program could be let to continue running and automatically mark matched comments as 'held for review', so they can be restored if incorrectly removed.
* Channel 'Mega-Scan' - Automated process to scan all comments on every single video on a channel.
   * Could theoretically pre-calculate the total number of comments needed to be scanned, and determine how many could be done in one go
   * Would need to implement a way to continue where left off, allowing user to either switch to a different google cloud project, or wait until the next day's quota reset

## Maybe Some Day
* Self-Hosted web version, wouldn't require downloading or setting up your own Google Cloud project

## Not likely
* Graphic User Interface
