## Currently Planned Features
* Simplified log file option: Option to create more basic log file without rtf color formatting, etc.
* Add channel ID whitelist
* Add 'only' option, like an opposite of 'exclude' - Only delete certain users from sample
* Option to search also obfuscated versions of entered strings

## Whenever I Get Around to It
* Monitoring Mode: Program could be let to continue running and automatically mark matched comments as 'held for review', so they can be restored if incorrectly removed.
* Command line arguments

## Maybe Some Day
* Auto Full-Scan Mode: Scans entire channel until more than ~100 comments scanned without spammer found, then stops automatically
* Self-Hosted web version, wouldn't require downloading or setting up your own Google Cloud project

## Not likely
* Graphic User Interface
